For more deeper and rich experience i would say go for higher model and also at this point since it is a very new devices i can see sometimes the device didn't respond but i believe that will be fixed with software updates.\",\n",
       " \"Prebooked it, haven't received it yet whereas other's who have booked after launch received one airway. I see now there are many other frustrated customers who have left similar comments. I was expecting by Friday, but now delivery date says Monday.Regarding the product itself, you can also read/watch other reviews - this is basically a redesign of 3rd gen echo dot, looks better (in my opinion) and sounds slightly clearer. If you want better sound go for the larger echo or invest in a good Bluetooth speaker and use this only for Alexa capabilities. The Alexa app couldn't detect the Wipro smart bulb (that's sold as a combo) in the first attempt, it takes a to couple of steps if you know what you are doing.\",\n",
       " \"This review is going to be different. As most of you by now would know it is a great device and so forth. However, I had to return the device due to its software glitch. It becomes unresponsive. Most of you might not experience this. Here is why. Most of the people will be happy with its decent speaker output and these group of people are not going to face this issue. But,  for the folks who would look for extra base and sound quality are going to suffer because they are going to connect this with external bluetooth speaker. :)This is my second Echo Dot 4th Gen and it still has the issue. So after spending sometime with the second device I finally found the cause and the solution. It happens when I pair with external bluetooth speaker. It becomes unresponsive while it is disconnected from bluetooth speaker. To make it work you have to switch to the paired bluetooth speaker or press the mute button and unmute again from the deviceNow you might be thinking why do we have to do all that, it might work by simply unpairing the device. I am sorry it doesn't work even if you unpair/delete the device.Currently the only solution is to 'factory reset' (by pressing and holding the action button for 25 sec) and do a fresh setup. PLEASE DO NOT PAIR WITH ANY BLUETOOTH speaker. I used this without pairing with BT speaker for two days and it works great without any issues.I am going to return this device.I hope Echo team knows this issue and they fix it by releasing a software update.\",\n",

       " 'This is just a life changing thing. Being an audiophile, it is very rare for me to overlook sound quality for an audio device but damn is this one good exception. This device just plays music in the most accessible way I\\'ve ever experienced. The first experience of just giving a voice command to play the song you want to hear while you are engaged with something else, is just life changing. No longer do I have to interact with my phone, connect my headphones and then listen to the song after searching for it. This device just takes out the friction of the music listening experience which is present on traditional devices.The smart features are pretty amazing too. Well, that\\'s the bread and butter of this device so that was pretty much expected, and this device did deliver. The \"Skills\" and \"Routines\" in particular are very good features and just expand this device\\'s capabilities as a smart home hub exponentially.Coming the the sound quality, I would say it is okay at best. The highs are decent and the mids are very clear but the low end is sub-par. The maximum volume level is acceptable and the audio does not distort much at the highest volume. Also, the mics on this thing are amazing. Overall, I would say that the sound quality is acceptable at least. The sound is not very tiny and is apt for casual music listening sessions, or just having some background music on.On top of it all it is also a very good \"toy\" for the elders and kids alike. I find my parents asking random and hilarious questions to Alexa and it is just a great side benefit.So, to sum this review up, the Echo Dot is one hell of a device, and is a great buy regardless of your intended use. This is just great!',\n",

       " \"I have been using this for only a week, so its my initial impression:Ordered the combo of 4th gen echo dot, firetv stick lite and wipro 9W smart bulb at 4900 with SBI credit card offer.First of all, those features which are not mentioned anywhere:FireTv has its inbuilt bluetooth through which u can connect your echo dot and use it as an external speaker for your TV/Monitor, whichever you are have connected your FireTv stick to. I bought Lite version coz I am using a monitor, power and volume buttons doesn't work on a monitor so no point buying normal FireTv stick. You can control echo dot's volume with Alexa voice vommands even when its connected through bluetooth with fireTv. Bluetooth connection process is very easy, just to to settings in FireTv, remote and bluetooth devices, search for other bluetooth devices, and it will show you Echo dot option.Coming to smart bulb , 9W is ok for a small room, definitely not worth its listed price of 599, but given the price of combo its really a steal!U can control it with echo dot and Wipro app!You can connect google next mini also as bluetooh speaker with FireTv stick but the ecosystem will not be compatible and u won't be able to give commands to your TV or Monitor!If u have prime, life would be easier as Amazon Music is default search for playing music by voice command ( you can select spotify also).Overall good combo pricing. Any bluetooth speaker also would cost around 2 to 3k, and I dont need battery backup for home use, and also speakers with battery builtin last less than normal ones.Overall Its good for Tech enthusiasts who want to taste some nextgen flavour, where IOT devices would be all around us!\",\n",

They asked me to place order for a new one, and once its delivered to return the old one in the new one's packaging and I would get the money back once the old one reach them.I did that and currently waiting for my refund as well as hoping that this one would last a little bit more than last 4th Gen.I would like to add here,I have gifted echo 3rd gen to my friends who has been using it regularly for more than a year without any issue of any sort.\",\n",

Better to buy in showroom Amazon no cost reduction waste, atleast some dhiwrooms they foes few free fittings and outdoor unit stand for free. Overall Panasonic we can go, but noise is bit equal high with LG, but Daikin is so silent operation but cost is higher dide 4k and installation as well....I say as all say LG...

We had to do multiple followups, two technicians came after 36 hours (Note : they promised the issue will be resolved in 24 hours), these technicians told the cooling is less and the front panel lock is not closed, while trying to close the front panel one of the technicians broke the lock, after argument they called the service supervisor (Gunasekar ( EmpCode: 18645) - Supervisor - Goodluck Aircon) and he accepted to replace it, I asked for the same in mail which he is hesitant in providing that.

Noise level:I personally find the noise level a teeny tiny bit on the higher side compared to other brands. But there is a workaround for this. You can set the fan speed to 'Quiet' mode while you sleep and it works like a charm.2. The AC only shows the desired temperature but not the current room temperature. ☹️3. Voice Control:I know I already mentioned voice control in the 'Pros', but it is not perfect. I have only tried it with Google Assistant, not Alexa. There are a couple of issues with voice control. I'm unable to power the AC OFF and unable to turn on 'Jet Stream' mode using voice control. Voice control works fine for all other operations.

Not because of any quality issues with the product, the product is built perfectly fine, but because it doesn't do much to reduce the laptop temperature. It's expecially not useful when you are gaming and I am just a casual gamer. My laptop has 2 built-in fans whose speed can be controlled. With that in-built fan speed kept to maximum, the CPU temperature, while Gaming, still goes all the way up to 90°+ if I play for a couple of hours(1-2hrs). Even after using this cooling pad, the only difference I see is a drop in temperature by 1° or 2 ° max or none at all. I don't think a price tag of Rs. 1000 or plus is justified for just a 2° drop.As far as the product is concerned, it has a metallic mesh top. Plastic bottom, 5 fans with red led, 2 controllers for fan speed (though speed isn't that much)- one for central fan and second for the corner fours and is very light and the usb connector provided is good quality braided. You can't apply much pressure on top of the cooler as it will get flex and fans will hit against the metallic mesh.Overall not a bad product, but coming back to my initial point, the question is whether you really need it and are you ready pay a thousand Rs for a drop of max to max 2°. The answer, I painfully found out was that, I atleast didn't need it.\",\n",

After I started using this Zinq laptop cooling pad the surface of the laptop (around the key board & specifically towards the right side air vents) became bearable to touch, otherwise it used to be red hot. The RED LED lights are unnecessary addition & there should have been a button to only turn the LED lights off & not the Fans along with LED lights.

Plus, it is dead silent, which was completely unexpected. The red lighting is a welcome addition, makes it look cool. All 5 fans are functional and blow cool air. I see no structural issues either. I think it is an awesome product!One thing that bugs me is that it is powered by a full-sized USB A port. Which means I need to carry that cable everywhere. I would like to see a new version having the fans powered by either a micro USB or a type-C, and I think it would make this product flawless for under 1200.

       " \"First of all, the biggest myth about cooling pad is that they reduce the maximum temperature reached by cpu and gpu. But that is not true, during thermal throttle temperatures rise but when it reduces using a stand or a cooling pad reduces temp. further (about 5 to7 degrees more) than not using one. The maximum temperature reached will be more or less same. One more important thing, I use Asus TUF A17 laptop.So, coming back to 'Cool Slate' review, it is a good buy in this price range. After one month of use it has not given me any problems, all fans are working and the strength is pretty good. But I doubt it can survive large falls like 6ft or so. The fan speed is decent, you would not expect it to blow air like a table fan, would you? Its a cooling pad and not a table fan so, the speed will be less. A cooling pad allows more air to flow to laptop and and not blow air to it. I mostly use it as a stand with fans off but, I need to turn fans on when I play heavier games like gta 5, ac valhalla. I don't need to use fans for lighter games like fornite.Check maximum temperatures for your laptop and use fans accordingly, you don't need to use the fans always. My laptop doesn't slip off the cooling pad. I don't use the stopper at all as my laptop doesn't slip. The stopper does not bother me, its in middle and doesn't come in between and bother you. I just don't use it because I think I don't need it. I have to push back my laptop just a little back because the exhaust vents get blocked and more air cannot come out when I play heavy games, other times I don't need to.Its a bit heavy cooling pad and with my 2.6kg laptop it gets very heavy but its comfortable on laps and you don't feel that much weight.It supports and fits my 2.6kg and 17inches laptop perfectly so, others and smaller laptops should definetly fit.So, overall a good buy.\",\n",

If delivery people don't answer phone calls and don't bother to call back, then Amazon Large Appliances team or customer service team has no way to reach out to them and the customer is expected to wait until whenever delivery happens, as per the delivery vendor's whims and fancies. Delivery vendors have little to no product knowledge, as the generic owner's manual gives more information than the delivery vendor. Also, my installation appointment was changed without prior notice or consent, or any intimation whatsoever. The installation vendor called a couple of hours before installation but decided to abscond by turning off his mobile phone when he was supposed to actually come. So a customer can get appointments rescheduled to working days as per the comfort and convenience of the installation vendor, without notifying, informing or taking consent of the customer. If Amazon Large Appliances Division has zero control on anything related to service, they should first try to have proper processes or protocols on how things should work, and then look at selling the appliances. It seems like Amazon has hired 'MBA Freshers' in the Large Appliances Division who make fancy board-room presentations about hiring a vast army of cheap third-party vendors who do a great job. In reality, they are probably aware of how pathetic the ground reality is, and they themselves probably don't buy appliances from their own business category on Amazon.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve been in the Fitbit ecosystem for a while, having owned a Charge, Blaze, Aria and 3 Ionics (They kept breaking) This is a super long review to help potential buyers as much as possible as this is a costly device. If I\\'ve missed anything you want to know, please leave me a question and I\\'ll try to answer. Skip to the bottom for the TLDR summary.Updated review 17/01/21====================Just a quick update to my review with the new features. ECG has now been added (in the UK anyway), it\\'s a simple 30s affair. Just place your thumb and forefinger on opposite sides of the bezel and 30s later you either get told your heart beat is fine or \"inconclusive\". Is it accurate? Who knows, but there are a lot of hoops Fitbit have to jump through to get approval for such a feature, so let\\'s assume it is. If you get multiple \"inconclusives\" it\\'s worth a checkup. No complaints, good feature.Google Home has now been added to the voice assistants along with Alexa. Personally I still find them both useless as they don\\'t work when you\\'re not within Bluetooth range of your phone, and range does seem awful. If I walk to my kitchen (20-25ft) and leave my phone in the office it will lose connection, and only randomly reconnect when it feels like it (I assume when it next tries to sync). Even if you walk back within range and then try to use the feature IT STILL DOESN\\'T WORK. It tells me to use my phone and do a sync. Well, if I\\'m picking up my phone I may as well just use Alexa/Google on that? Again, this is just a battery saving exercise that cripples functionality.The speaker works! Well, Google/Alexa will respond with voice anyway. But I can\\'t help but feel saying \"Set a timer for 5 minutes\" and getting a voice response saying \"OK\" should also mean when the timer expires I get some kind of sound. But no, the watch just still vibrates instead. Come on? I know Fitbit are a small company but a device with a speaker that doesn\\'t give an option to make a SOUND when a timer expires? Come on.My original 3 star review stands at this point. The Sense is merely an Ionic (£140) with a bezel that can do ECG and EDA tests. Let\\'s hope the Google acquisition which has now completed gives Fitbit the budget they need to push onwards. Is the Sense worth it? No. Can better firmware/software save it? Possibly. But I can\\'t help but feel the next generation with Google funding will be the one worth waiting for.If you want a tracker right now? Well I\\'d *love* to try the top offerings from Garmin or Huawei as they are definitely catching Fitbit but my budget doesn\\'t allow for that. My opinion? Wait for a price drop, £300 is too much.Original review============Coming in at £300 RRP again, this is Fitbit\\'s flagship model. Taking a look at the basics:* Aesthetics - 5/5Very impressed! Available in black/grey and a more effeminate \"pale rose gold\", the colour options are pretty limited. No steel grey, or shiny silver - for now anyway. Whatever colour you choose, you\\'re stuck with as the entire watch is the same colour, so choose wisely. The watch itself has a \"squircle\" shape (a square-ish circle, or a circle-ish square :P) that actually looks much better than I expected. Quality wise, it all looks great. The Ionic looked a bit awkward and cheap, especially around the lip of the screen but the Sense looks well crafted and uses the good stuff like aerospace-grade aluminium and Gorilla glass. The screen also has big, smooth rounded edges making swipes super-comfy. A massive improvement, it looks simple yet elegant, good job Fitbit, best looking watch you\\'ve ever made (Check my photos)The strap is the newer design that doesn\\'t have a buckle and folds in and under itself for a lower profile. The whole watch and strap feel nice and light, secure and comfortable. No complaints.* Screen - 3/5Initially, I was very happy with the screen. At 1.58\" it helps my aging eyes a little. Bright and clear and now AMOLED so it outputs super-black blacks that really help make the screen blend into the surrounding bezel - you can\\'t see where the screen ends and the bezel begins unless you\\'re in very bright light. Also note that AMOLED gives the option of an always-on mode. I\\'m especially happy about this, if only to get rid of the awkward but painstakingly long moments when someone asks \"what\\'s the time\" and you do the ol\\' \"Fitbit-wrist-flick and stare\" - waiting for the watch to turn on, often in vain. Being AMOLED any part of the screen that is black is using negligible battery power, so there\\'s the potential for some really long battery life. It\\'s worth noting the actual screen itself (or the part you can see anyway) is also a squircle. This means clock faces with a solid background look a bit odd and show the thick bezel and also means there\\'s no corners to put stats in. With AMOLED I\\'m not sure why they didn\\'t just use a square screen and leave the corners black.So why 6/10? Well my first Sense had a strong red tint to all colours as they got darker. This meant all gradients appeared to fade out to red. My replacement (thank you Amazon) was much better, but now has a slight red tint all over the screen, along with more black crush and some greeny yellows. I\\'m either desperately unlucky or the Fitbit Quality Control isn\\'t that hot. I would feel bad abusing Amazon\\'s goodwill any more, so I\\'m keeping this one. You may not be as picky as me however but bear it in mind. I was, and still am, disappointed.* Default watch face designs and UI - 3/5For unknown reasons, Fitbit\\'s watch face designs are almost always awful and there\\'s no change here. Awkward layout and often with no settings to let you choose what stats you want to see (sigh) You can thankfully download a new one from 1000s created by 3rd parties (Fitbit really should pay some of these developers and use their designs) Note Fitbit still don\\'t have a proper store payment method (Don\\'t they want a cut from purchases?) so it means you have to go to 3rd party pages and pay a couple of dollars to random sites, which all feels a bit nasty. It\\'s also worth noting if you download a watch face without an always-on display, you get stuck with Fitbit\\'s defaults which are UGLY (See photos) And to make matters worse, only \"certified\" developers are allowed to make a watch face with an always-on display so the choice is a bit limited for that.The UI itself is an improvement, but it\\'s still very basic with minimal animation and a lot of flat-shaded graphics. There\\'s a fine line between minimalism and just looking too simple/basic, and it leans towards the simple side a bit too much. It\\'s also a bit laggy at times. Sometimes animations just skip straight to the end, sometimes taps and swipes go awry. The compromises to save battery are starting to feel a little too much and the basic UI does take away from the premium look of the Sense somewhat.* Features - 5/5Firstly, let\\'s not underestimate the importance of this one - A SPEAKER. Yes you heard correctly, it finally makes a noise! Well, it does when you initially turn it on, other than that I haven\\'t heard a peep out of it. I\\'m assuming eventually there\\'ll be an option to have audible alarms and to make the UI and the buttons beep when you press them etc. but for now, it\\'s just *another* feature to wait for. It\\'s the 21st century guys, c\\'mon.Microphone. Currently at launch we have Alexa integration. Well, there\\'s a certain irony in using a fitness device to do things like turn the lights on and off so you don\\'t have to get up, but the option is nice to have. It doesn\\'t speak back to you, you just get text on the screen however. There is mention of taking and answering calls using the speaker and microphone, but it\\'s not here yet so don\\'t assume it will ever arrive.\"The button\". You\\'ve probably heard about this if you\\'ve read any other Sense review. There\\'s no physical buttons any more, just a weird single indentation on the left of the Sense, just below the strip used for EDA and ECG scans. However, in use it\\'s not as bad as it sounds. You have to actually squeeze the Fitbit harder than expected to activate it, but otherwise it\\'s fine, with a satisfying vibration. If you have hairy arms like me though, you\\'ll keep tugging on them as you press with your whole thumb which isn\\'t that comfortable :)Heartrate Sensor. It has the PurePulse2.0 sensor which is allegedly more accurate but I can\\'t say I\\'ve noticed it responding any quicker or being any more accurate than the Ionic. If it is an improvement, it\\'s not much and a look around at some in-depth tests show it\\'s lagging behind the competition a bit. For resting heartrate and steady state cardio it\\'s fine, if you do lots of HIIT you may see more issues with accuracy.Blood Oxygen Sensor. As with the Ionic, right now this only works when you sleep - there\\'s no spot testing. Also worth noting in the app you only get a graph showing the variance, not the actual percentage. If you can be bothered to select a certain watch face at night, and wear it for about an hour after waking, you get an actual percentage range but this is far from ideal. Let\\'s hope Fitbit fix this to work with any watch face.Electrodermal activity (EDA) Sensor. Put your hand over the screen and it measures your stress level over a 2 minute (or longer) period, looking essentially at how much you sweat. How accurate it is, I\\'m not sure, but the results definitely seem to be lower when I feel more relaxed. This goes towards a \"stress management score\", along with activity levels and sleep quality. Fitbit are a fan of these arbitrary numbers, but getting them higher (or lower) is almost like a game. This is a good thing as I find myself purposely taking 2 minutes out of my day to take the test which is good for mindfulness and relaxation. Also, I want to beat yesterday\\'s score. In your face yesterday\\'s me!Built in GPS. Took a couple minutes to connect the first time, under 20s the second time. Solid and accurate enough for me looking at the routes plotted on Google maps that it shows in the app on my phone.Electrocardiogram (ECG). Measure your heart\\'s rhythm for irregularities that can lead to stroke, etc. It\\'s been approved by the relevant bodies in the US, UK and various other countries but the app to do it isn\\'t here yet. It should be soon (October), but until it is, it\\'s another omission and a sign the Sense has been rushed to market.Notifications from your phone can be shown on your watch, but the usual restrictions apply. e.g. your phone has to be nearby, and you can only reply if you use Android. It\\'s too clunky to really bother with imo.It also has the usual Fitbit specs (altimeter / gyroscope / etc) and now also tracks additional stats that are shown in the Fitbit app on your phone (discussed later)* Watch Apps - 2/5There\\'s still a very limited selection of apps, and they\\'re all constrained by the same simple graphics and low performance as the OS itself. I rarely find myself using any of them, bar the main ones for tracking exercise and the ones required to do EDA and ECG scans.Spotify - still only lets you control the music, not download it to your Sense for offline playback. Note the Sense has no data connection unless it is connected to your phone. This saves battery, but it necessitates the ability to download music! What\\'s the point of onboard GPS if you need to take your phone too for music anyway?Deezer - who even uses this? I assume Fitbit have a deal with them but I have enough subscriptions thanks. Support what people use please Fitbit, not what you want them to use.There\\'s also basic apps for settings timers and alarms but they\\'re all a bit clunky. There\\'s also apps to help you with breathing and mindfulness but unless you\\'re trapped somewhere you don\\'t have your phone, they\\'re hardly worth the effort.* The main Fitbit App on your phone - 4/5It doesn\\'t change much but is solid enough. I can happily say I\\'ve had NO problem with syncing the Sense with the app. Literally every Fitbit I\\'ve ever owned has had trouble with this. For the Sense there\\'s a new section called \"Health Metrics\" which includes:Breathing rate - how many times you breathe in and out per minute as you sleepHeart rate variability - this is a new one for me. It calculates the difference in time between your heartbeats - worth reading aboutSkin temperature - you don\\'t get a core reading (it\\'s on your wrist remember) but you get to see the variance which may warn you of a possible rise in core temp tooOxygen saturation - if you use the special watch face at night...Resting heart rate - Same data as beforeStatistics are great, there\\'s nothing quite like exercising, working hard to get fitter and seeing tangible changes in your numbers. Fitbit know this and are throwing more numbers than ever at you. Don\\'t worry too much about absolute values as this is just a watch on your wrist remember, it\\'s hard for it to be too accurate with such a limited amount of data coming in, but working on making those values move in the right direction is the core addiction. I can honestly say seeing statistics improve in the Fitbit app (and seeing how they tank when I\\'m lazy and/or drink alcohol :P) is great motivation to do better each day.* Half a star off for:Fitbit Pay. One of the disappointments on the Ionic continues to disappoint, at least for us in the UK. Santander is still the only major bank represented, along with a \"who dis?\" list of others. I\\'m worried by the continued lack of Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, etc. Is it a security issue? Or Fitbit laziness? Either way, the UK is still considered not cool enough to pay for stuff with a tap of the watch. Boo.Fitbit Premium. Thanks for paying £300 for your new smartwatch, enjoy it! Oh and btw, if you want to access ALL the stats you have to pay a whopping and frankly wholly unrealistic £8.99/mo to see them. You get 6 months for free with the Sense and for now it\\'s mainly the more advanced sleep statistics that are behind this paywall (and some coaching videos, but not many), but who knows what else may end up there - it really isn\\'t clear in the app. This double dipping is not cool, the processing/storage required for these statistics is minimal. I really hope they remove this charge or at least massively reduce it. If you want £8.99/mo (same as Netflix) you need to provide something NEW for it every month Fitbit.* SummaryAt first I thought the Sense had been rushed out of the door somewhat to capitalise on the pandemic and peoples\\' interest in their health, but I think it was more to compete with the 3 new Apple watches. Let\\'s get this clear, the Fitbit is for you if you want a 24hr health and wellness wearable. The battery lasts for 5 days, and you *should* wear it at all times to accurately and properly track your health as much as possible. Ill health doesn\\'t wait for your battery to be charged :) The Apple watch has a 16hr battery life. It looks better, runs much faster, does sp02 spot checks and uses a proper slick OS. If you just want an exercise tracker and spot checking, it\\'s a better choice. If you\\'re more interested in your general wellbeing and fitness trends throughout the entire day and just want to \"wear and forget\" something, the Fitbit is the one. I feel like Fitbit need to stop trying to compete with Apple, they\\'re a different market imo, and just focus on themselves. That said, I do wish Fitbit would worry a little less about battery length and more on performance. The UI struggles at times to keep up, scrolling is still a bit lumpy and I am concerned that things will only get worse as more features get enabled and more compromises are made. Google are in the process of acquiring Fitbit so we can expect some positive changes in the future, but for now the Sense has done \"just enough\".* Should you buy it?If you\\'re looking for an upgrade from a Versa or Ionic, I\\'d personally wait for the ECG app to work and a more sensible use of the sp02 sensor. When they\\'re here, it\\'s a solid choice. If you have an older Fitbit, this is a nice piece of kit and a worthy upgrade. Consider the Versa 3 though if you aren\\'t bothered about EDA or ECG.TLDR:The Sense is good, but not quite good enough right now - with the potential to be great.A slightly-generous 3 stars.This review will be updated as more features become available.

       " 'Da ich auf der Suche nach einer guten Fitnessuhr/Smartwatch bisher nicht fündig geworden bin, hoffe ich das die neue Fitbit Sense mich überzeugen kann!Vorweg: Ich habe bereits die neuste Galaxy Watch sowie eine Fitbit Ionic und auch die neue Oppo Watch getestet. So das ich damit recht gut vergleichen konnte.► Optik und erster EindruckZuerst einmal muss ich sagen, das ich schon etwas von Fitbit enttäuscht bin!Die Ionic Reihe wurde aktuell bisher nicht weitergeführt und stattdessen kommt nun die Fitbit Sense in dem selben Design wie die neue Fitbit Versa 3.Versteht mich nicht falsch. Das Design an sich ist nicht schlecht aber warum spart man bei einem neuen Modell an einem neuen Design?Meiner Meinung nach an der falschen Stelle gespart.Abgesehen davon war die Ionic so interessant, weil diese eben ein ganz anderes Design hatte. Schlank, etwas größer und eckig.Warum macht man die Sense also nicht auch eher in die Richtung? Für mich absolut unverständlich und daher ein Negativer Punkt in meiner Bewertung.Wenn ich ein anderes Modell kaufe, hätte ich mir auch eine andere Optik gewünscht, vor allem wenn die halt 100€ mehr kostet.Ansonsten wirkt die Uhr solide! Qualität wirkt soweit super, Spaltmaße ebenso.Das Design an sich ist wie erwähnt sicher nicht schlecht, auch wenn ich oft nicht verstehe warum das Display nicht mehr an die Ränder geht, so wie andere Hersteller das auch hinbekommen.Ich finde das sieht dann immer nicht ganz so hochwertig aus, einfach weil wir alle wissen was heutzutage Möglich ist. Dies passiert vermutlich auch aus Kostengründen.► Ein paar Technische Daten zur Uhr- Kompatibilität: Android ab 7.0 / iOS ab 12.2- AMOLED Display- WLAN 802.11 b/g/n (2,4 GHz)- GPS / GLONASS- NFC- Bluetooth 5.0- EDA-Sensor- EKG- SpO2 Messung (Sättigung des Blutes)- Hauttemperatur- wasserdicht bis 5 Metern Tiefe- 6 Tage AkkulaufzeitDas sind die Daten womit geworben wird.► Akku/LaufzeitDer Akku bzw. die Akkulaufzeit ist eines der größten Faktoren bei einer Smartwatch.Ist diese zu kurz, ist der Spaß an der Uhr recht schnell vorbei.Denn der Sinn an so einem Fitnesstracker ist ja eigentlich möglichst viel von seinem Körper \"aufzunehmen\" also zu Tracken und zu speichern.Das ist natürlich nicht Möglich, wenn man täglich die Uhr für mehrere Minuten oder teilweise Stunden (bei anderen Herstellern) ablegen muss.Hier muss man sagen, war Fitbit schon immer eine der Top Uhren.Bereits meine Ionic hat locker mal 3-4 Tage gehalten.Die Sense wird nun aber mit 6+ Tagen angegeben, je nachdem wie man diese natürlich nutzt. (Kennen wir ja alle, wie die Hersteller immer werben...)Das ist vom Hersteller natürlich auch wieder um den heißen Brei geredet. Allerdings würde ich schon schätzen das sie vielleicht etwas länger als meine Ionic hält und ist somit trotzdem von der Akkulaufzeit her eine der besten Uhren auf dem Markt.Dank der Schnellaufladefunktion ist die Uhr aber auch nachdem der Akku leer ist, schnell wieder geladen.Fitbit wirbt zwar mit 12 Minuten und dann reicht es einen ganzen Tag, allerdings ist das natürlich alles Nutzungsabhängig.Sie lädt zwar schnell auf, allerdings nicht schneller als manche Konkurrenz. Was allerdings nicht schlimm ist, denn die Konkurrenz hält dafür nicht so lang.Die geworbenen 12 Minuten laden die Uhr übrigens nicht voll, sondern nur rein rechnerisch so viel, das sie einen Tag lang halten \"könnte\".► BedienungDie Bedienung ist wie bei allen Fitbit Uhren natürlich sehr einfach und schön geregelt.Die App leitet einen durch die komplette Installation und zeigt einem was alles Möglich ist.Ansonsten ist die Uhr genauso übersichtlich gestaltet wie bisherige Modelle auch. Dort sind tatsächlich keine großen Unterschiede.Vieles ist über die Uhr selbst aber auch über die Fitbit App zu verändern und anzupassen.Ich muss allerdings sagen, das der neuartige Sensorknopf mega nervt!Total schlecht zu bedienen, man muss irgendwie immer die richtige Position treffen usw.► EDA-SensorDer neuartige EDA-Sensor ist eigentlich DIE Neuheit bei der Fitbit Sense.EDA heißt übrigens Elektrodermale Aktivität.Der Sensor misst die im Grunde die Haut. Beispielsweise durch Schweiß.Die Uhr soll so erkennen, ob man z.B. man unter \"Stress\" steht.Dafür gibt es im System (also bei den Apps) eine App Namens EDA-Scan.Dort kann man einen \"schnellen Scan\" starten, welcher dann 2 Minuten geht. Währenddessen wird empfohlen das man die Uhr an den Arm drücken soll, damit die Kontakte vom Sensor tatsächlich aufliegen. Hier muss ich sagen, irgendwie schon blöd gelöst oder? Warum muss ich die andrücken? Warum sind die Sensoren nicht besser gesetzt?Also irgendwie schon blöd 2 Minuten lang seine Uhr auf den Arm zu drücken.Der Stress Test wird dann wieder ganz normal, wie alle Daten, in der Fitbit App gesammelt/gespeichert und dort dann ausgewertet.► Rückseite (Weitere Sensoren und Aufladen der Uhr)Die Rückseite sieht sehr aufgeräumt aus. Sehr sortiert und gleichmäßig und gut verarbeitet.Neben dem eben erwähnten EDA-Sensor hat die Fitbit Sense natürlich auch weitere Sensoren.Darunter zum Beispiel einen Sensor, welcher jede Nacht die Körpertemperatur misst.Ist die Temperatur abweichend, so wird die Uhr laut Fitbit anschlagen. Ob das natürlich geht, kann ich bisher noch nicht feststellen, da ich bisher Gesund bin.Toll ist aber auch der GPS Sensor, welchen einige kleinere Fitbit Versionen ebenfalls nicht hatten.Damit lässt sich also auch ohne mitführen des Smartphones z.B. beim Fahrradfahren eine Strecke erstellen.(Der GPS Sensor war übrigens damals der Grund für meinen Kauf der Ionic)Weiterhin gibt es ansonsten die üblichen Fitbit Tracker, also Strecken, Kalorienverbrennung usw. Das übliche eben!Ich denke dazu brauche ich nicht so viel erzählen.► Ladestation/ZubehörÜber die Ladestation hat man bisher ziemlich wenig gehört gehabt.Diese ist im Grunde aber recht einfach. Ziemlich genau so groß wie die Unterseite der Uhr.(Siehe meine Bilder)Die Uhr wird dabei einfach auf die Ladestation gelegt und lädt dann recht schnell auf.Gibt sicher schnellere Aufladestationen (Beispiel: Oppo Watch) allerdings hält die Fitbit Sense wenigstens recht lange, was bei der Konkurrenz oft das Problem ist.Schnell laden aber schnell leer, bringt mir im Endeffekt weniger Tragezeit, als wenn ich etwas länger laden muss aber dafür halt nicht täglich.Zubehör wird es für die Fitbit Sense eine Menge geben, denn die Versa 3 ist ja ebenfalls neu auf dem Markt und hat eigentlich genau das selbe Design.Hier ist der einzige Vorteil, warum die Fitbit Sense gleich ist.Für mich aber kein Grund ein neues Modell wie ein anderes aussehen zu lassen, denn im Grunde hätte man den Verschluss der Armbänder zum Beispiel ja identisch machen können und der Sense z.B. ein etwas eckigeres Design geben können.Mitgeliefert wird übrigens ein Armband in Größe S sowie eins in L. Also eigentlich sollte jeder erstmal direkt die Uhr nutzen können.Auch dies ist bei manchen Herstellern um einiges schlechter!Mein Favorit bei den Armbändern ist übrigens das Perforierte Lederarmband von Horween, direkt von Fitbit vertrieben.Es gibt zwar massig Hersteller aus China, die günstigere anbieten, allerdings zeigt sich dies immer in der Qualität.Auch bei meiner Ionic habe ich das Perforierte Lederarmband direkt von Fitbit. Einfach Top!► Farb- bzw. ModellauswahlZur Auswahl gibt es zum Start der Uhr zwei Möglichkeiten.Einmal die \"Mondweiß/Edelstahl Softgold\" Version sowie die \"Carbon/Edelstahl Graphit\" Version.Würde mal sagen das die eine eher Frauen anspricht und die andere eher Männer bzw. Fans von schlichteren Farben (Schwarz).Finde die Auswahl aber ganz gut. Viel mehr braucht man eigentlich nicht. Silber wäre natürlich schön gewesen aber wird bestimmt irgendwann auch kommen.Bei der neuen Versa3 im selben Design gibt es Schwarz, Altrosa/Softgold und noch Nachtblau/Softgold.Die letzten beiden Unterscheiden sich aber nur im Armband, mehr nicht.Direkt mehr Auswahl bei den Armbändern hätte ich mir auch bei der Sense gewünscht. Hätte es am liebsten direkt mit dem eben erwähnten perforierten Lederarmband gekauft.► BetriebssystemDas System ist wie bei Fitbit üblich ganz gut aufgebaut.Es ist so an sich recht flüssig und wirkt auch gut strukturiert.Allerdings hatte ich bei den älteren Modellen von Fitbit ständig Probleme mit dem Syncronisieren.So hat die Uhr teilweise tagelang nicht syncronisiert. Ich hoffe das ist hier nun verbessert.Sollte dies nicht der Fall sein, werde ich meine Bewertung natürlich zeitnah anpassen.Ansonsten gibt es eigentlich nicht viel zu sagen. Alles wie man erwartet hat.► Sense oder Versa 3?Kurz mal diese Frage eingeworfen für diejenigen, die unschlüssig sind!Wer gerne mehr Tracken möchte, also EDA-Scan (Stresstest) und Körpertemperatur (+ Warnung), der sollte zur Sense greifen.Will man das allerdings nicht bzw. braucht man das nicht, dann wird die Versa 3 vollkommen ausreichen!Immerhin sind das 100€ Unterschied, für nur ein paar Kleinigkeiten. Da muss jeder selbst wissen ob einem das Wert ist.Ich denke der Aufpreis ist nur gegeben, da in der Sense viel neue Technik ist, welche recht neu auf dem Markt ist.Anders hätte man vermutlich die 100€ Aufpreis nicht bewerben können, ohne einen neuen Namen. Auch deshalb wieder echt blöd, das man kein eigenes Design dafür überlegt hat!► Kaufempfehlung/FazitPositive Punkte:- Hochwertige Haptik/Qualität- Schnelles Betriebssystem (auch wenn es ausgereifter sein könnte)- Sehr tolles Display mit richtig guten Farben- Großer Akku mit viel Laufzeit- Tolle Auswahl an Zubehör (Fitbit üblich)- Geringes GewichtNegative Punkte:- Kein eigenes Modelldesign (Minus Punkt hierfür)- Kein Google Pay (Nur Fitbit Pay mit wenig Banken die das unterstützen, also eigentlich nicht nutzbar)- Nerviger SensorknopfDer Sensorknopf war wohl eher gewollt als gekonnt von Fitbit.Da Frage ich mich tatsächlich, wer sich das ausgedacht und ausgetestet hat. Man muss so nervig und verkrampft den Knopf drücken und das bei so einer teuren Uhr?Wie bei jeder Fitbit ist die Uhr eher eine Fitnessuhr und keine Smartwatch im klassischen Sinne. Das merkt man natürlich anhand der ganzen Gesundheitsaspekte/Apps.Sämtliche Sensoren die alles Mögliche Messen weisen bereits darauf hin. Finde ich aber auch soweit ganz gut!Was ich allerdings total schlecht finde, das Fitbit Pay immer noch kein PayPal, keine Visa Karten bzw. an sich mehr Banken anbietet.Man kann praktisch diese Funktion kaum oder gar nicht nutzen und das ist echt traurig!Dadurch ist die Uhr halt wirklich eher eine Uhr um sich selbst zu tracken und vielleicht mal die Uhrzeit abzulesen. Mehr eigentlich auch nicht.Fraglich bleibt für mich aber bisher noch ob alte Probleme gelöst wurden. Beispielsweise gibt es einige Versa1 und Versa2 Kunden deren Uhren kaputt gegangen sind. Darunter meist durch Wassereinlagerungen in der Uhr nach dem Schwimmen. Hoffen wir das Fitbit das Problem hier natürlich nicht hat. Auch hier werde ich nachliefern, falls mir etwas negativ auffällt.Kaufempfehlung: ✔️ JaDie Fitbit wirkt im großen und ganzen gelungen.Sollte es bei Fitbit Pay weitere Zahlungsmöglichkeiten geben, wäre das natürlich Weltklasse.Allgemein ist die Uhr auf dem Markt so bisher die beste Uhr, die ich hatte.Dazu sei aber gesagt, das ich kein Fan davon bin z.B. WhatsApp Nachrichten auf der Uhr zu lesen/schreiben oder ähnliches. Dafür hab ich schließlich mein Smartphone.Die Uhr kann aber Benachrichtigungen anzeigen, also das geht schon. Falls jetzt jemand sorge hatte.Vermutlich wird dies aber sehr auf den Akku schlagen!Wer also eine tolle Fitness Uhr sucht, die eine lange Akkulaufzeit, viele Sensoren und Möglichkeiten bietet, der wird hier fündig!Wer nicht ganz so viele Sensoren braucht sollte besser zur Versa 3 greifen und 100€ sparen!Ich behaupte das diese Uhr mit Abstand die bisher beste Uhr von Fitbit ist! 👍Dennoch gibt es \"nur\" 3 Sterne, da ich es schon echt Frech finde, eine teurere Uhr im Design einer günstigeren zu machen aber einfach einen neuen Namen zu verpassen um anzupreisen, dass es was viel besseres ist. Da hätte man sich halt einfach mehr Mühe geben können oder das Design der Ionic weiterführen und dort einfach die neuen Sensoren verbauen.Außerdem ist der Sensorknopf so dämlich gemacht, eine Frechheit bei dem Preis.An sich schwanke ich derzeit zwischen 2-3 Sternen, wegen der zwei-drei doch schon starken negativen Punkte.Mal sehen wie die Uhr auf dauer überzeugt! Dann werde ich die Bewertung natürlich noch anpassen!Danke fürs lesen meiner Rezension, ich hoffe ich konnte dir damit helfen 🙂',\n",
       " 'News: (Mai 2021): schlechte Neuigkeiten. Die Uhr lädt nicht mehr. Die Option die von Amazon angeboten wird, lautet: Uhr Einsenden zur Reparatur.Einfach ärgerlich, aber alternativlos.Zwischenzeitlich hat sich auch das \"Armband geht selbstständig ab\"-Problem verschlimmert. Das passiert regelmäßig, zum Glück immer Zuhause.News (7.10.20): EKG App wird ausgerollt, somit kann ein 30 Sekunden EKG am Bildschirm der Uhr gemacht werden. Funktionsweise: mit Daumen und Zeigefinger diagonal Finger am Gehäuse wird Messung durchgeführt. Daten werden in der Fitbit App zu einem \"Bericht\" ausgewertet.((Nachträge - Updates -> werden unterhalb hinzugefügt.))Seit einem Jahr beschäftige ich mich mit \"Fitnesstrackern\" und habe mit\\xa0 einem 25€ Fitnesstracker (besserer Schrittzähler mit Uhr und Pulsmesser, Akku läuft lange) gestartet, hatte zwischenzeitlich eine Garmin SmartWatch (Klotz! Täglich am Ladegerät, kaum Gesundheitsfunktionen) bin  dann zur Fitbit Versa 2 gelangt. (Ich habe mich Recht schnell in die Versa 2 verknallt.)Die Fitbit App in Kombination mit der Aufzeichnung und Auswertung der für mich wichtigen Daten war anfangs gewöhnungsbedürftig, nun begleitet sie mich täglich. Ich  schätze die Auswertungen, die in der App geboten werden. Und ich behalte im Blick wie ich schlafe, wie aktiv ich bin. Das sind auch meine zwei wichtigsten Funktionen.(Dennoch teile ich die Werte nicht bewusst mit Freunden oder der ganzen Welt.)Es war reine Neugier, die mich nun zum Kauf der Fitbit Sense verleitet hat. Neugierig war ich mehr auf das Stressmanagement, als auf alle anderen neuen Gimmicks, wie zum Beispiel GPS Integration.Mein Fazit vorab: ich hätte auch mit der Versa 2 gut weiterleben können. Die kostet aktuell die Hälfte der Sense. So wahnsinnig viel mehr bringt mir die Sense nämlich nicht. Ich geb ihr 3 Sterne weil sie mich nicht vom Hocker reißt und gemessen an meinen Erfahrungen und Erwartungen eher enttäuschend. (In den Nachträgen erkläre ich, warum es schließlich nur 1 Stern ist.)Zu den mir relevanten Punkten gehe ich in Schlagworten einzeln ein. Man mag sich bitte selbst ein Gesamtbild machen, welche Funktionen einem wichtig erscheinen.Armband: maximale Enttäuschung, aus mehreren Gründen:(-) Armband löst sich selbständig vom Gehäuse!!! -> No-Go! Hätte fast meine Uhr im freien auf einem Acker verloren. (Siehe Nachtrag 2)(-) Silikon:\\xa0 Ich kaufe eine Fitnesstracker um mich nachhaltig und achtsam zu verhalten, und dann wieder ein allerbilligstes Silikon Armband!? Bei der Fitbit Versa 2 bekam ich nach 7 Tagen (dauerhaft tragen) eine unschöne Hautreaktion. Habe dann Gewebe und Leder Armband bachgekauft, das war nicht extra teuer, aber sinnvoll!(-) Ersatz Armband? Für die Fitbit Sense (und Versa 3) gibt es noch keine Ersatz Armbänder, die nicht auch aus Silikon wären.Die Fitbit Sense und Versa 3 haben ein neues Befestigungs-System zum Armband Wechsel. -> das find ich extrem blöd!Ich kann gar nicht sagen wie viele Stunden ich schon gesucht und recherchiert habe. Für die Versa 3 und Sense findet man noch keine \"Generika\" Armbänder aus Leder, das ärgert mich im Moment extrem, da ich die Uhr mit dem Silikon Armband (Original) nicht dauerhaft tragen werde können.(-) Stressmanagement: neue Funktion. Muss man aber aktiv messen, nennt sich EDA Scan. Dauert 2 Minuten (Handfläche auf Uhr legen).Ich wollte das im Laufe eines \"bewegten\" Arbeitstages machen, stell aber fest dass mich das zusätzlich aufregt, wenn ich 2 Minuten beide Hände blockiere um Stress zu messen, nur damit ich weiß dass ich mich gestresst fühle? Irgendwie habe ich da was anderes erwartet.(+/-) Fitbit Premium? Habe für 3 Monate\\xa0 Fitbit Premium kostenlos \"aktiviert\", kann jetzt im Moment nur sagen dass die vielen guten Statistiken durchaus beeindruckend sind, aber ich kann das nicht mehr so einfach von der \"Standard\" Variante unterscheiden, da mit der neuen Versa/ Sense Generation auch in der normalen App neue Funktionalitäten dazu gekommen sind.Bei Fitbit Premium ärgert mich, dass viele Unterstützungen in deutscher Sprache angepriesen werden, dann aber nur in Englisch verfügbar. Auch bei Hilfe Seiten ist das der Fall. Wenn ich recherchieren möchte wie die Stressmanagement Messung oder Hauttemperatur Messung ausgewertet wird und überhaupt ... lande ich auf Fitbit Seiten im Englischer Sprache.\\xa0Das überzeugt nicht wirklich.Werde Premium dann Rechtzeitig kündigen.(-/+) Premium Mitgliedschaft?Es kursieren auch unterschiedliche Angaben, wieviel Premium (/Jahr) schließlich kosten soll. Rund 100€ muss man wohl berappen.Bin noch unschlüssig ob es mir das Wert ist.(-) Geführte Trainings und Meditationen. Werden in der App angeboten, sind aber größtenteils in Englisch verfügbar. Gefällt mir gar nicht.(+) Schlaf Auswertung: Die überzeugt mich weiterhin. Kenn ich ja schon von der Versa 2.\\xa0 Mir bringt das wirklich viele Erkenntnisse und somit auch Hebel zur Optimierung. Die Sauerstoffsättigung (SPO2) gibt\\'s schon bei der Versa 2. Bei Versa 3/ Sense nichts neues. Aber das ist nun mal überzeugend.(+) Schrittzähler. Den finde ich auch zuverlässig (wie bereits in Versa 2). Mit einigen Tätigkeiten ist der Schrittzähler freilich überfordert. Mountainbiken oder Motorradfahren. Hier werden wohl Erschütterungen gezählt. Das habe ich jetzt zur Kenntnis genommen und es stört mich nicht.(+) Aktiv-Minuten Zähler: Klasse! Zeigt mir am Ende eines Homeoffice Tages super was ich hätte besser machen können.Am Ende eines Haushalt- und Garten-Tages auch spannend!Ne, im Ernst: man kann sich nicht immer den ganzen Tag aktiv und regelmäßig bewegen, und wenn man solche wenig aktiven Tage hat, kann man mit zusätzlichem Sport noch etwas entgegen wirken. Mich motiviert das jedenfalls. Auch aus dem Grund weil ich weiß wie schnell sich Verspannungen und Trägheit in Kopfschmerzen/ Nackenschmerzen bemerkbar machen.(+) Treppen Zähler? Ich dachte, dass sowas nie hinkommen kann, aber Pustekuchen. Die Sensorik in der Fitbit Versa 2 bekam das schon hin und auch in der Sense wird hier zuverlässig gezählt.(+) Hauttemperatur Messung: das ist mir noch zu neu, als dass ich hier viel dazu sagen könnte. Vielleicht wird es relevant wenn Schnupfen oder Erkältung im Anmarsch. So lange man gesund ist, schlägt hier nix aus...Die Hauttemperatur Messung ist jedenfalls neu im Vergleich zur Versa 2! Ich setze noch große Hoffnungen in diese Messungen und mögliche Erkenntnisse daraus.(-/+) Trainings Optionen:Es gibt schön viele Sportarten für die es Trainings Erkennung gibt, und die man auch manuell starten kann. Was mir noch immer fehlt, ist Ergometer (Fahrrad). Meine Lieblings Aktivität zwischendurch Zuhause ist nicht als solche auswählbar, das find ich enttäuschend. Immerhin gibt es nun Crosstrainer als neue Option. Oder auch Spinning.Das ist allerdings nicht so von bahnbrechender Bedeutung. Man kann ja am Puls die Fettverbrennungszonen erkennen, sofern man sich ein wenig damit beschäftigt/ auskennt.Die automatische Trainings Erkennung funktioniert gut, aber hier lege ich nicht unbedingt Wert darauf. Ich bin kein Sport Freak, mir geht es darum regelmäßig motiviert zu werden um fit zu bleiben.(+/-) Lade Zyklus: Angegeben mit 6 Tagen. Hängt aber schwer davon ab wie man das Display einstellt. Im Rahmen erster Tests alle Funktionen und verschiedene Ziffernblätter hat der Akku zwei Tage geschafft, ist dann aber wie versprochen ratzfatz aufgeladen.(!) Ladegerät für Versa 3/ Sense ist übrigens nicht mehr identisch mit Versa 2! Es sind 4 Pins die magnetisch an der Rückseite der Uhr abkoppeln. Das Ladegerät ist ein wenig praktischer als der \"Käfig\" von der Versa 2.Eine Ladestation kann man optional nachkaufen, für mich aber nicht erstrebenswert.(+) Bedienung am Display. Da ich durch die Versa 2 schon ein wenig Übung habe, komm ich mit der Sense gut klar. Zumindest beim wischen am Schirm.Ich finde die Bedienung von solchen Fitnesstracker-Bildschirmen immer etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, vor allem wenn dann nicht das passiert was man durch \"wischen\" erreichen hat wollen.(+/-) neues Versa iOS:Mit dem neuen iOS der Versa 3 und Sense kamen wohl neue Menü-  und Wisch-Optionen hinzu. Ich bin selbst ganz überrascht, dass ich das alles sofort verinnerlicht hab. Tippen, wischen nach oben/ unten / links ... Alles unterschiedlich belegt.Extrem unschön finde ich es, dass Fitbit dieses neue iOS nicht auch älteren Fitbit Modellen spendieren wird. :-((-) kein Bedienknopf mehr links am Gehäuse. Das ärgert mich tatsächlich sehr. Sehr. SEHR!Da ich kein Always On Ziffernblatt eingestellt habe, muss ich immer an der Uhr links mit einem Finger länger am Sensor dran bleiben, bis der Bildschirm angeht. Das nervt! Bei der Versa 2 war es ein Knopf -> man hat einmal draufgedrückt und Zack! Bildschirm an. Das ging mit dem Zeigefinger der anderen Hand.Diesen\\xa0 versenkten Sensor den die Sense verbaut hat, betätigt man richtig schwer, unhandlich mit viel Verzögerung und das nervt extrem.Man kann diesen versenkten Sensor Knopf entweder einmal länger oder zwei Mal kurz drücken und dann in den Einstellungen verschiedene Schnellzugriff Optionen anwählen.Ich habe es bisher nicht geschafft zu kapieren, wie man zwei Mal drückt. Keine Chance. Keine Ahnung was ich hier falsch mache.DER SENSOR KNOPF NERVT.(+) Aussehen: Ist natürlich total subjektiv, diese \"Bewertung\", doch mir gefällt das Äußere, der Schirm\\xa0 und Rahmen sehen brilliant aus, alles sehr hochwertig. (Bei dem Preis soll das ja auch so sein.)Gefallen tut mir die Sense durchaus.(+) Nachrichten anzeigen vom Handy auf dem Bildschirm der Sense? Funktioniert tadellos.Habe diese Option nach einem Tag abgestellt. Brauche ich nicht. Alle Push Meldungen vom Handy werden am Schirm angezeigt. Man kann sogar WhatsApp Meldungen als gelesen markieren oder kurze Antwort senden.Das - und viele weitere Funktionen - machen die Sense zur SmartWatch.(GPS) Im Vergleich zu den Vorgängern hat Sense und Versa 3 den GPS Sensor in der Uhr eingebaut! Das heißt, man kann -wenn man auf Aufzeichnung der Strecke besteht- ohne Handy laufen gehen und alles aufs Handy (die App) synchronisieren.Das ist eine Funktion die sehr oft gewünscht und angefragt wurde.Mich interessiert diese GPS Funktion allerdings nicht.Ich nehme Handy zum laufen und Mountainbiken immer mit. Ich weiß ja nicht was passiert und in Pausen brauch ich es zum fotografieren.(...) Es gibt wesentlich mehr Funktionen, wie Sprachsteuerung und bezahlen Funktionen, die mich zurzeit nicht interessieren. Darum kann ich hierzu nichts berichten.(-) Display Schutz wäre auf jeden Fall auch angebracht, hier\\xa0bin ich von Fitbit enttäuscht. Dass man bei weit über dreihundert Euro nicht ein Stück Folie mit dazu geben kann, finde ich enttäuschend.Meine Erfahrungen mit Display Schutz bei der Versa 2 sind sehr gut. Ich werde auch für die Sense eine Folie kaufen.Ob diese Hüllen - die ich Irrsinnig praktisch und schmückend finde! - in Kombination mit dem dämlichen, versenkten Sensor Knopf funktionieren können, müsste ich erstmal recherchieren.Die Hüllen gibt es in lustigen Farben, so eine Hülle ist schnell drüber gestülpt und schützt maximal. Vermutlich geht dann EDA (Stress) Scan auch nicht mehr.Hier müsste man abwägen ob man für robuste Tätigkeiten sich nicht besser doch eine Hülle zulegt.!!! Die Hüllen für Versa 2 passen übrigens auf die Sense/ Versa 3 drauf. Der Bedienknopf geht dann halt nur nicht mehr.**********Fazit habe ich ja bereits oben erwähnt: Ein bisschen ärgere ich mich, weil ich diese teure Uhr gekauft habe. Ich hätte mich weniger geärgert wenn sie die Hälfte gekostet hätte. Da es bei solchen Produkten allerdings üblich ist, gehe ich davon aus, dass auch hier der Preis noch sinken wird. Es ist und bleibt jedoch eine subjektive Entscheidung, wieviel einem so ein smarter Tracker wert ist.Und freilich behaupte ich nicht, dass man überhaupt einen benötigt! (Bei mir ist es jedenfalls so: ich bin dieser Art Auswertung meiner Lebenszeichen regelrecht ausgeliefert :-)Nachtrag:Die Bedienung mit dem Sensor Knopf ist für mich im Moment absolut indiskutabel. Ich finde hier einfach Null System darin. Ersatz Armband oder Hülle oder Display Schutz würde ich erst kaufen wenn geklärt ist ob ich sie nicht zurück sende.Nachtrag 2:3 auf 2 Sterne geändert.Gestern fiel mir mitten auf einem Acker, ich hatte gerade Blumen gepflückt, die Uhr vom Handgelenk. Eine Armband Befestigung hatte sich selbständig vom Gehäuse gelöst. ->ein absolutes No-Go!Zum Glück habe ich es gehört wie die Uhr auf den Boden fiel. Im Gras hätte ich das niemals gehört. Beim Laufen oder Mountainbiken auch äußerst unwahrscheinlich dass man das rechtzeitig merkt.Die Befestigung des Armbandes am Uhrgehäuse funktioniert anders als noch bei der Versa 2. Es ist eine Art kleiner Knopf den man drückt um ein Armband zu lösen. Das Armband wird ohne Betätigung eines Pins wieder befestigt. Es fühlt sich an als ob das Armband Ende magnetisch ans Uhrgehäuse andockt. In Wirklichkeit ist es aber ein gut geführtes \"stecken und verhaken\"-System.Diese Neuerung an der Versa 3/ Sense finde ich extrem kundenunfreundlich und das Gegenteil von Nachhaltig. Es bedeutet dass man Armbänder von Vorgänger Uhren wegwerfen kann. Es bedeutet dass man zunächst nur ein Original von Fitbit kaufen kann.Für Fitbit mag das ein gutes Geschäftsmodell sein, für mich als Kunde ist es ärgerlich. Zumal die neue Art der Befestigung für mich ein Konstruktionsfehler ist.Nachtrag 3. Heute beim Laufen hab ich dauernd aufgepasst ob ich die Uhr nicht wieder verliere.Beim aktivieren der Sportart habe ich wie üblich wieder zig Versuche benötigt um mit dem Sensor Knopf die Bedienung überhaupt zu aktivieren. Da hätte theoretisch schon das Stressmanagement anschlagen können - vorausgesetzt man versteht überhaupt was das Stressmanagement macht und wozu es gut ist.Zumal meine Begeisterung sich wegen des billigen Silikon Armbandes auf den ersten Blick in Grenzen gehalten hat, und weil ich die Uhr nicht verlieren möchte, ehe ich sie zurück sende, hab ich beschlossen die Sense wegen dieser Mängel zurück zu senden.Gerne hätte ich noch weiter probiert was die neuen Auswertungen so für Erkenntnisse nach sich ziehen, aber das Risiko die 330€  einfach so vom Handgelenk zu schütteln... ist mir jetzt doch zu hoch. Der permanente Stress den mir die Bedienung beschert kommt erschwerend hinzu. Vielleicht ist an meinem Gerät aber auch etwas defekt an dem Sensor Knopf!?Grundsätzlich  sehe ich das auch selbständige lösen des Armbandes das tatsächlich als groben Mangel.Nachtrag 4 - der vorerst letzte:Vor der Rücksendung wollte ich in der App noch einmal die \"Tagesleistung\" überprüfen und stelle fest, dass seit gestern keine Synchronisierung stattgefunden hat. Aha. Seltsam... Das ist insofern seltsam, weil die App für \"heute\" exakt die Schritte anzeigt, wie sie auch auf dem Bildschirm der Uhr angezeigt werden. Trotzdem sagt mir die App seit einer Stunde dass keine Synchronisierung möglich ist.Vermutlich wird die Sense wieder einmal nicht gefunden. Vergleichbare Probleme hatte ich bereits mit der Versa 2. Einmal ging sogar gar nichts mehr. Mit Unterstützung des Kundenservice (zuerst Amazon, dann weitergeleitet an Fitbit Support) gelang es dann wieder die Uhr mit der App zusammen zu bringen (in Kurzform: Fitbit App deinstallieren, Speicher leeren, App neu installieren, Uhr neu anmelden).Wenn das alle paar Monate mal passiert, mag man da noch darüber hinwegsehen. Der Versa 2 habe ich diesen einmaligen Ausrutscher bereits verziehen. Ich habe auch schon von Fällen gelesen wo die Uhr sich überhaupt nicht mehr verbinden ließ. Das ist dann freilich bitter ... Und man kann nur hoffen dass in solchen Fällen noch Garantie/ Rücksendung/ Kulanz Ersatz besteht.Grundsätzlich gilt: wenn eine Fitbit Uhr durch eine andere ersetzt wird, meldet man sich freilich mit seinem eigenen Account neu an. Alle bisher gespeicherten Daten sind dann weiterhin verfügbar! (Das ist das Tolle an der Cloud. Das ist das Fragwürdige an der Cloud. Kann man so oder so sehen.)Nachdem ich von der Versa 2 auf die Sense umgestiegen bin, sind meine bisherigen Daten und Statistiken weiterhin vorhanden. Durch die Sense kamen nur neuere Werte hinzu, die es eben vorher nicht gab.Wenn ich nun auf die Versa 2 zurück gehe, läuft das auch alles wie gehabt weiter.Nachtrag 5:NEU: es gibt jetzt die EKG App!(!!!) Herzfrequenz Messung. Hier habe ich beunruhigende Infos gefunden. Die Herzfrequenz Messwerte sind nicht zuverlässig und wenn ich das YouTube Video von Quantified Scientist im Kontext mit den vielen kritischen Stimmen zur Pulsmessung ansehe, dann wird es extrem ärgerlich. Die Fitbit Sense misst in oberen Bereichen verzögert (Messung laggt). Die positive Vermutung dahinter: das ist ein Software Problem. Anders herum, wenn es nämlich ein Hardware Problem wäre, wäre es ein k.o. Kriterium für diese Uhr. Man muss also hoffen, dass der Fehler bald behoben wird und wer aktuelle und zuverlässige Pulsmessung haben möchte, sollte mit einem Brustgurt Gerät (Polar) messen.-> In dem Kontext, dass es eine Benachrichtigungsfunktion für hohe/ niedrige Pulsfrequenz gibt, auf die man sich ja verlassen können sollte, ist dieser Fehler bei der Messung alleine schon sehr kurios.Es ist schon eine ziemliche Zumutung, dass Fitbit solche unausgereifte Produkte auf Kunden loslässt. Ich möchte den Zahlen ja auch vertrauen können.((((-: genug Gemecker ... ihre Entscheidung :-))))Nichtsdestoweniger wünsche ich allen stolzen Käufern, aber auch den \"Testern\" viel Freude damit ... Und viel Glück damit auch. :-p',\n",
       " \"Do not buy it yet, it is unfinished. None of the features that advertised before is working. Google assistant, ecg, making / taking calls etc is not available yet.Mobile App is useless. You cannot update or download any application nor change any clock face. It gets stucked in the process of downloading and red line constantly moves from left to right in download bar. As expected no viable solution yet apart of resetting, clearing cache, turning off / on Bluetooth.. Etc. ( none of them worked).Eda sensor do not tell you much, can't figure out how to tackle stress management through the app with no direction, don't know where to look, what to look and more importantly we don't know how accurate is that. Blood Oxygen level can only work with one single watch face, and if you are lucky to download it through app which I failed, go ahead and test it. Right now this function is useless for me as well. Os is so buggy and sluggish. Do not expect fast scrolling like Apple, Samsung offers. That touch button on the left and side is hard to reach and not comfortable to use not to mention how buggy it is.Seriously I do not understand where those 5 star ratings coming from. This watch is clearly not finished, and was released too soon. I guess Fitbit is using us to do beta testing. How come I abondon my galaxy watch to buy this. Do not buy it yet until they fix it properly. Do some online research, this watch does not deserve that price tag.\",\n",
       " \"I am a rare person I moved from apple watches to Fitbit as I really loved the products and community that surrounded this. So I bought my new Fitbit sense yesterday and opened it up today with some what a 'sense' of excitement.As soon as the box was opened I was impressed with the larger screen which had better resolution and better responsiveness, flicking through the screens is a breeze unlike my clunky old ionic.I LOVED the new charger (this is a thing I am sure many Fitbit owners would agree on good products shame about the chargers) and I was very excited to try this bad boy out.I tried the stress management application where you place your hand over the screen and its okay but it felt a bit gimmicky but it was not why I got it.The SPO2 on this watch can only be used 1. with the correct watch face and 2. only whilst you are sleeping. This makes no 'sense' also this watch face is available on my trusty ionic so if you have an ionic do not buy the sense for this.The watch strap is a terrible design. I have average sized wrists and usually am a large in the watch straps ut the large for the sense appears to have been distend for people who want to wear it on their hips, it is HUGE!!! so I went with the small and it was on the last one or two holes which meant that the excess strap was not staying in place.This is not the only design floor, I use the watch to take daily, time sensitive medication and I use it for an app called eat slow which helps me to control my eating habits; The vibration on the sense is so slight, so minimal I missed many of my cues.I could not find anywhere that the strength of the vibrations could be increased meaning making it useless wo me for the very practical reasons for which I have the watch for.Then we have Alexa, yes it has Alexa. However they do not tell you in an obvious and bold way that you have to press a button, yes the voice assistance is not voice activated I do not see the 'sense' in that.Which leads me to the last and most frustrating part of this woeful watch the side button. All the other complaints can be fixed with software updates but this is a hardware issue. The side button is on the side of the watch and it's a touch sensitive button however between 40-50% of the time I tried to press the button it failed to activate or do anything. Pressing the button is so irritating and frustrating and often fails to work. This is a huge problem as this is how you activate Alexa. I can understand once in a while it not activating but this is excessive and inexcusable.I cannot believe this is supposed to be an upgrade to the ionic and at 300 quid (minus a penny) there is not enough improvement to warrant the price tag. What Fitbit should do is improve the ionic and boom.I have worn the sense for less than 7 hours and I have taken it off removed it from my phone and my ionic is back on my wrist and the sense is going back in the morning, the return label is printed and I am now looking at going back to apple.Fit bit you have failed, please take this hunk of junk off of the market and come back when you have a decent product.Your once loyal supporter and soon to be Apple Watch wearer, Andrew.\",\n",

Then they take my music away so I have to carry my phone with me again. Like other users have said, this makes no sense why Fitbit would do this. There is plenty of space on the device!It's a huge shame because overall it looked good but forcing users onto £10 a month paid music streaming services whilst at the same time taking away the ability to listen to personal music is inexcusable.Back to my Versa 2...\",\n",
       " 'Hice la tarea, estudié opiniones, vi videos y demás. Me animé por la actualización para las llamadas, por los análisis de sueño que ahora se iban a incluir en la versión no premium de Fitbit y por la rebaja de más de 4000 pesos. Total, lo compré, la primera opinión es que es un smart watch bonito; repito sabía todo.Que muchas de las carátulas te cuestan. Cierto.Que mucha gente se quejó del botón. No me importó, y es muy cierto que tienes que desactivar la función de dejarlo apretado, de otra forma vas a iniciar lo que programaste porque se inicia a cada rato cuando presionas la muñeca..Que no se puede guardar música y que se requiere una cuenta premium de Spotify para que sirva. Cierto.Que su sistema operativo no es tan ágil como otros. Muy cierto.No me importó nada.Hasta que un día me levanto con la noticia que había recorrido mil pasos durante la noche, pensé que había sido una falla del sistema, hasta que empezó a pasar todas las noches.Empiezo la investigación, encuentro que más gente reporta lo mismo, que no hay una forma de borrar los pasos y la quema de calorías ficticia, ah, y que probablemente sucedería lo mismo mientras manejo.A ver, un reloj que te cuesta 9000 pesos, ni siquiera puede hacer esto bien. Tienen una aplicación frustrante, de verdad, y nunca pude hacer funcionar el asistente de google.Total, si buscas un reloj «diferente» que se vea bien, pero con el que batalles para las cosas más esenciales, no busques más. Este es para ti.',\n",

       " 'La verdad es que ha sido una auténtica decepción, adquirí uno para un familiar y otro para mí y al final he tenido que devolverlos. Paso a enumerar todos los problemas que he tenido:1. El botón háptico a veces no funciona.2. A veces no recibes las notificaciones y si las recibes correctamente se van almacenando, pero llega un momento en el que se borran y ya no puedes responder ningún mensaje.3. Solo puedes responder a los mensajes, pero no puedes enviar ningún mensaje sin que previamente no te hayan enviado uno.4. Hay momentos en los que falla buscar el móvil, y cuando lo busca y suena el teléfono, permanece apagado, por lo que a veces tienes el móvil delante y aunque suene no lo ves. Para que pare de sonar tienes que darle a \"parar\" en la pantalla, no sirve poner la mano para que cese la búsqueda.5. No puedes acceder a ciertas apps de mensajería, solo las prefijadas por fitbit, por lo que es una restricción bastante importante para aquellos que usamos varias aplicaciones de mensajería.6. Fitbit te dice que puedes responder llamadas con este smartwatch, pero no es así, solo puedes descolgar, pero no puedes usar el micrófono del smartwatch para hablar, lo que hace esta característica es ponerte el móvil en función manos libres, que si lo tienes guardado en algún lugar cerrado, tampoco te escucharán.7. Alexa es muy restrictiva en este dispositivo, no puedes enviar un mensaje o llamar, solo sirve para hacerle preguntas del tiempo o quién es el presidente del gobierno.8. Muchas aplicaciones están en inglés, como la meditación guiada, que no es que no me defienda con el inglés, pero fitbit debería haberse tomado cierto interés con los idiomas.9. Y ya por último decir que de momento no trae el asistente de Google ni la función electrocardiograma que dicen que integra, lo implementarán más adelante, pero a día de hoy no están disponibles.Lo único bueno de este smartwatch es la duración de batería que dicen que tiene (unos 6 días), el diseño y su calidad, que con su acabado con bordes en metal y el cristal gorilla glass lo convierten en un wearable bastante elegante.',\n",
       " 'I am changing from Apple to Android soon (still waiting for my Pixel 5!), and hence changing my watch as well. I saw the Fitbit Sense coming out and went for it. My review will include unbiased comparisons with Apple Watch.1. DesignThe watch is light and nice looking. I like the stainless-steel bezel which is similar to my Apple Watch series 3 sapphire version. The square face is a bit new to me, but it’s not obstructive at all in daily usage, and it makes the watch looks bigger, which is nice (to me. On smaller wrist like my wife’s, it will look too big).The watch has metal connectors on its back for charging. These on the Fitbit Charge 3 did give me skin allergy so I was a bit hesitate, but I am fine with these connectors so I suppose they have changed the metal with the Sense. A thumb up for Fitbit.However, I dislike the watch strap. As many other reviewers have pointed out, the strap is either too short or too long. In my case, the short one barely makes it whilst I am on the second to last eyelet in the long one with almost 5cm of spare strap. It goes inside the strap anyway so not flapping about, but they should have made a Medium size.2. Vitals trackingThe Sense can do everything a fitness tracker can do: it counts steps, measures heart rate, tracks your sleep, take your skin temperature when you sleep, even counts your breaths and tells if you are stressed or not. It has dedicated sport mode which has different types of sport. With pandemic and local lockdown, I have not had the chance to actually try out all of the functions. However, it was disappointing that the watch does not detect workout automatically. The Charge 3 did, albeit incorrectly (probably why the function was removed for latter models).The sleep detection works, and it works better than any of the smartwatch I have used. My Apple Watch detected that I went to bed and slept at 10.30PM although I was lying in bed reading on my e-reader until 12AM. The Fitbit did capture the sleept time correctly. This is me wearing two watches to test this function, and I did not touch my phone. Mind you, my Apple Watch is a Series 3 and I have not had the luxury to try out the newest version yet so can’t say Fitbit has beated Apple in terms of sleep tracking.The SpO2 indicator is newly introduced to this watch, and it only measures when you sleep, along with your breath rate, skin condition. Unfortunately, all of the data is hidden behind a paywall (premium subscription). I find it rather unfair since the data is there, and the watch is capable of capturing it. But oh well, it’s their business strategy so I won’t discuss further. I have applied for the trial Fitbit premium coming with the watch to see if it’s worth it. In my view, it’s not. You get some extra information about your skin temperature, your sleep score, the phases of your sleep (REM sleep, deep sleep, awake, etc.), and your heart rate during sleep. Again, a shout out to Fitbit for capturing my sleep precisely here! A quick trip to the toilet is also captured whilst my Apple Watch totally missed it (again, it’s 3 years old).Another new function in this model is EDA (stress measuring, basically). It’s nice, but I don’t think it’s that helpful, and accuracy is doubtful as well. There are days that I was stressed by work (I work remotely from home but I work with numbers, and I work 10-12 hours lately due to increased workload), but the watch couldn’t tell. I measured and tried putting my mood as Neutral, nothing happened and the watch logged it as that. I think this needs improvement here.3. SoftwareThis is where the Sense is lacking. It tries to be a smartwatch, and a fitness tracker at the same time, but its software has failed the goal. I feel that this watch has been rushed out of the door in order to beat a competitor’s watch so that its software has not been fully developed and thought out.The most annoying part I found is the fact that notifications disappear too quickly or does not stay on screen with a flick of the wrist. So when I have a notification, I will have to press the home button to wake the screen, or flick my wrist, then pull down the from the top of the screen with my finger to go through the list of notifications. What’s more, the notification won’t go away despite already cleared on phone. I call this is because the phone and the watch cannot ‘talk’ to each other. It’s just a one-way transmission of data from the phone to the watch.The watch only performs limited smartwatch functions so it won’t be able to interact with calls (take call, end call, mute. It seems that this is something that is “coming soon” so hopefully in the next update.One more thing I dislike is the fact that you can only use SpO2 function if you select the only one watch face available with this function. And that face is ugly! I do not understand why the sensor cannot just measure it automatically and store in the watch/send to phone so I can view it on my phone instead? Again, this feels too rushed to beat the release date.And lastly, as mentioned above, the watch and the phone cannot talk to each other. I have multiple health data store in Apple Health so the watch should have at least been able to tap into that (at least my weight since I use a smart scale from a different company!).4. SummaryThere are good and bad things about the Fitbit Sense. The watch is a promising device which can accurately track vital information as well as finess activities. It can also act as a smartwatch with limited functions. However, its software needs a few more updates until it can completely please the users. And Fitbit’s new paywall system (Premium service at £79.99 per year) isn’t for everyone.EDIT: so my Pixel 5 has finally arrived. I have a chance to test this on Android and now updating my feedback to show the difference in terms of software (the Sense has just had a new software update last night as well. It took more than an hour to finish!):- On Android, it is possible to transfer data between Fitbit and Google Fit app using a medium app called FittoFit, which will pull data from Fitbit and update into Google Fit on a set schedule. Clunky, but it works seemlessly so I\\'m happy with that! At least all my health data can be stored in a centralised place and if/when I move away from Fitbit, I will not lose them.- Notification can now be interacted to a certain extend on Android. I suppose this is because Android is a more \"open\" system comparing to Apple iOS. Messages and emails can now be marked as read on the Sense and they will disappear on phone (still doesn\\'t work the other way around except for messages! Boo!). I can reply to messages with some set templates (OK, Call you later, Thank you, etc.) and these templates are customisable, which is good.- Still no interaction with calls.- My wrist is getting itchy after wearing this for half a day (no working out yet!). I\\'m really not good with this silicon strap. I will need to find a replacement ASAP!Will come back and update this review periodically if I find out something new.',\n",
       " \"Fitibit sense dovrebbe fare un sacco di cose, promesse nella pubblicità e nelle caratteristiche riportate, ma....non le fa.E' uno sport watch, assolutamente non smart. Infatti, acquistandolo a prezzo pieno, si ottiene un orologio ricco di aspettative che nel pratico, non sono eseguibili. Prima fra tutte, l'ecg non ancora abilitato. Poi abbiamo google non ancora presente. La messaggistica è pessima, dato che non appena si riceve una notifica, questa sparisce appena la leggiamo senza restare in archivio. Non c'è ancora modo di immagazzinare musica per ascoltare solo con smartwatch, ma si deve utilizzare spotify oppure un altro programma a pagamento.Il gps con me non ha mai funzionato.C'è un parco app che non è ancora disponibile, e non capisco come abbiano potuto mettere il prodotto sul mercato se ancora non è attivo in tutte le sue sfacettature.Una cosa che mi ha motlo infastidito sono i grafici della app, incompresibili. Ossigenazione e temperatura si calcolano solo di notte e non si riesce  aleggerne i valori reali, ma solo percentuali assolutamente ignote.I passi sono soprastimati, poichè in mezza giornata raggiungi diecimila passi anche stando fermo e muovendo solo le braccia.Le attività sportive bloccano qualsiasi utilizzo dell'orologio, perciò non si può nemmeno uscire dalla schermata per cambiar musica o fare altro.Ci sono troppe cose che ancora non vanno e per il prezzo, direi che non ne vale ancora la pena. Bocciatissimo.\",\n",
       " \"Ancien utilisateur de la Fitbit Charge mon choix de remplacement s'était porté sur la nouvelle Fitbit Sens. La montre est attrayante et globalement correcte mais a de gros défauts rédhibitoires pour moi :Le glissé sur l'écran tactile réponds mal.Il faut taper très fort sur la montre pour sélectionner, ce qui est très pénible.Le seul bouton est situé à gauche, beaucoup trop bas ; il est difficilement accessible avec le pouce.Le bracelet difficile à verrouiller d'une main.Toutes les fonctions ne sont pas actuellement disponible ; pas de mesure de la température corporelle,Pas d'ECG.Une notification de MMS n'affiche pas les images et indique d'aller voir sur le téléphone !Les écrans disponible sur le store sont tous chiche et dépourvu d'intérêt.Cerise sur le gâteau, il faut maintenant un abonnement payant premium à 10 € par mois pour avoir les informations détaillées de suivi dans l'application dédiée.Conclusion Amazon toujours au top mais Fitbit a raté son coup sur cette montre ; il faut espérer que Fitbit mette rapidement à jour le logiciel de la montre pour lui enlever quelques petits défauts précédemment cités.\",\n",
       " 'ja, was soll ich sagen, wenn ich hier so die vielen Negativ-Rezensionen zur Fitbit Sense lese, dann frage ich mich, ob ich nun seit drei Tagen wirklich das gleiche Smartwatch-Produkt an meinem Handgelenk habe wie die anderen Schreiberlinge hier?! Ich hatte jetzt 3 Jahre lang die Fitbit Ionic, war mit der auch meistens sehr zufrieden. Und doch, die Sense spielt für mich jedenfalls in einer höheren Liga. Die Sense-Software ist von Anfang an sehr sehr stabil! (das ar bei der Ionic die ersten Monate nicht so) Der eine Touch-Bedienungsknopf an der Sense, links an der Seite der Uhr, funktioniert bei mir tadellos und immer zuverlässig und ohne rumzuzicken und ist optisch nicht dominant, was ich sehr mag. Viel besser als die vielen fast nutzlosen dicken Knöpfe der Ionic. Der Sense-Akku wird irgendwie gar nicht leer, obwohl ich täglich stundenlang an der Sernse rumdrücke und alles zigfach ausprobiere und obwohl ich genauso zigfach täglich mit der Fitbit-Smartphone-APP bewußt immer und immer wieder alle Sense-Daten synchronisiere und jeden Tag mit ihr 5 KM im Park Laufen gehe, samt aktiviertem GPS. Das GPS ist auch schneller \"Verbunden\" als bei der Ionic, Klasse! Optik: okok, die Eleganz der Ionic war immer, na sagen wir, nerdlastig. Mir gefiel die Optik der Ionic, aber ich gebe zu, es war eine streitbare Gefallen-Beziehung zwischen der Ionic und mir . Aber die Optik der Fitbit Sense, die ist von ihrer Eleganz einfach in einem völlig anderem Space unterwegs, sie sieht viiiel besser aus, als auf den Internet-Werbe-Bildern. Ist am Ende natürlich Geschmackssache. Und Nachts trägt die Sense auch gefühlt weniger auf als die Ionic, die Sense ist da einfach mehr im Hintergrund. Meine Frau will jetzt auch eine Sense... ooohh shit, hätte ich die sie ihr mal nicht so angepriesenUpdate: nun habe ich die Sense 5 Tage lang. Der Akku ist auf 8%. Gefühlt habe ich auf meiner neuen Sense jeden Tag mehrere Stunden rumgedrückt und alles ausprobiert. Hab jeden Tag Sport mit aktiviertem GPS gemacht. Wenn ich das rumgezappe auf der Sense auf ein Normalmaß runterfahre wird das Teil 6 bis 7 Tage ohne aufladen durchhalten. Supi!Übrigens: als ich die Sense von Amazon gesendet bekommen habe, war die Inbetriebnahme bei mir völlig unkompliziert und flüssig.Und was Amazon und dessen Angebots- und Bestell- und Lieferservice angeh: Dazu ist bei mir mal wieder alles sehr gut gelaufen! Amazon ist einfach Weltmeister in Sachen Zuverlässigkeit und Schnelligkeit. Warum können all die anderen Web-Unternehmen das nicht? Selbst schuld, wenn Amazon alle anderen mit großem Abstand auf die Plätze verweist. Lernen und besser werden... oder vom Markt weggeputzt werden... nennt man \"fittest of the survival\". Wer kauft schon gerne bei jemandem, der es nicht drauf hat, wenn es jemanden gibt, der es drauf hat? Sorry, wenn das den einen oder anderen hier jetzt erschreckt!']"
